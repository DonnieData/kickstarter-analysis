# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Analysis of Kickstarter campaign data 

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to produce insight into campaign outcomes through utilizing statistical formulas and visitation methods in Excel. 
With the primary focus being on a subset of data centered around Theater Campaigns, 
deliverables will be based on the relationship between the campaigns and their launch dates as well as their funding goals.


## Analysis Focus Questions
How do theater campaigns fair in relation to their launch dates and funding goals?

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Through utilizing Pivot tables, I am able to aggregate, group, and filter data.

Based on the calculated columns in the pivot table I have created the below visualization to further help in the analysis and find insight int the Outcomes vs Launch Date relationship.

Findings: 
-	Campaigns with goals less than $1000 had a high success rate.
-	A majority of successful campaigns had a goal within the $1000 – $4999 range.
-	cumulatively a greater portion of campaigns failed that have goals greater than the $15000 – $19,999 range.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

In order to have a more focused and overhead view of campaign goals
I have created a table with formula that allows me to collect statistics on campaign goals and group/ filter based on various criteria.  

![Launch Date Chart](https://github.com/DonnieData/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)

Findings:
- The largest portion of successful campaigns have launch dates in May 
- There aren’t any months in which there was a majority of failed campaigns 
- The month of May has the highest amount of successful campaigns compared to other months  
- The months of February, June, and July had predominantly successful campaigns 


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

possible challenges or difficulties....

## Results

Based on Theater outcomes in relation to launch dates I can conclude that it best to launch a campaign within the 2nd to 3rd quarter of the year. Inversely the data shows that there is less likelihood of success for campaigns launched in the 1st and 4th quarter of the year. Therefore, it is greatly recommended to avoid that time-frame. 

In regards to campaign goals to ensure the greatest possibility of a successful campaign, I recommend budgeting that would allow for a goal that is within the range of
$15,000 - $19,999

## Additional Information 

#### Limitations 
I find the lack of recent data to be a limitation of this data set. 

#### Further Analysis
Additional anaylsis steps that can be taken are creating more in-depth pivot tables with sub categories based on campaign goals within certain time frames.
